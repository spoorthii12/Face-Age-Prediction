Face Age Recognition:
This task involves training a model to predict a personâ€™s age (usually by categorizing them into age ranges) based on their facial features.



Problem Statement
Age estimation from facial images is an important task in computer vision with applications in various domains like security, marketing, and healthcare. The goal of this project is to predict the exact age or categorize a person into an age group based on their facial features using deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).









Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning-based classification model that can accurately predict the age group of an individual based on their facial image. By analyzing key facial features, the model will categorize each image into predefined age ranges. This involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to effectively recognize and distinguish age-related patterns across different demographics.

Application of Selecting the Project:
This project was selected due to its practical relevance in areas such as age verification, personalized services, and demographic analysis. It provides a hands-on experience in image classification while offering real-world applications.

Type of Training Dataset Involved:
The training dataset will consist of labeled facial images covering a wide range of age groups and demographic diversity. Datasets like IMDB-WIKI or Adience provide age-labeled facial data that will be used to train and validate the model. Preprocessing such as face alignment and augmentation will be applied to enhance the dataset quality.
